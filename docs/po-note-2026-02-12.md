# PO Note — Propane Tank Calculator (2026-02-12)

## Problem
Users often do not know how much propane remains in a tank before cooking, heating, or trips. Existing methods are inconsistent, and many users confuse tare weight with tank capacity.

## Target user
- Homeowners and grill users with 15–30 lb tanks
- DIY users managing propane for heaters, smokers, and outdoor equipment
- Anyone with a scale who needs a quick, no-login estimate

## Outcome goal
Help users get a fast, trustworthy estimate of:
1. Propane remaining (lb)
2. Percent full
3. Estimated gallons remaining

## Scope shipped in this iteration
### Step 1 — Input clarity and validation UX
- Added field placeholders with examples:
  - Capacity: `e.g. 20`
  - Tare: `e.g. 25.0`
  - Current weight: `e.g. 37.0`
- Added helper hint to reduce confusion:
  - "Tank size (max propane), not tare weight."
- Improved warning text when current weight is below tare.

### Step 2 — Faster tank selection
- Added common tank presets: 40 lb and 100 lb
- Added hint: "Pick a common size, or use Custom for any tank."

### Step 3 — Simple measurement instrumentation
- Added lightweight analytics events:
  - `calculation_started`
  - `validation_error`
  - `calculation_success`
- Current behavior:
  - Logs to console now
  - Auto-supports Plausible later if script is added

## Product decisions and tradeoffs
- Prioritized low-risk UX improvements over larger feature expansion.
- Chose simple analytics implementation first to avoid setup friction.
- Kept architecture lightweight to preserve shipping speed and learning cadence.

## What we learned
- Tiny UX copy changes can reduce user confusion quickly.
- Presets improve speed for common use cases.
- Instrumentation should be added early so future decisions are data-informed.

## Next hypotheses
1. If FAQ content is added, validation confusion events will decrease.
2. If shareable result links are added, return usage and referrals will increase.
3. If analytics is connected to a dashboard, prioritization quality will improve.

## Next sprint candidates
- Add FAQ section focused on common errors and tank assumptions
- Add share/copy result capability
- Connect events to a real analytics dashboard
- Improve SEO metadata and on-page content structure
